### Running Samples from the GitHub Repository

To run the samples, you will also need:
- **Visual Studio Code** installed on your machine.
- A **Git client** to clone the GitHub repository and run the samples locally. You can use the built-in Git feature of Visual Studio or a tool like **SourceTree** or **GitHub Desktop**.
- A **Microsoft 365 tenant** to test and deploy samples. You can get one for free by joining the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program).
